# Latest version 1.0.0.3
- [CEncryptor_1_0_0_3.exe](https://github.com/CryptoToolCommunity/CEncryptor/blob/main/Win/CEncryptor/zVersions/CEncryptor_1_0_0_3.exe "CEncryptor_1_0_0_3.exe") - windows version
- Others platforms? I didn't need... but maybe I can create if needed.

# What do this app do?
You can encrypt your seed phrase with password using this simple freeware. 
- It uses [PKCS #7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_7 "PKCS7") encryption with password (I'm open mind for suggestions, if my aproach is not enaugh secure)
- It's simple. 
- It's open source. 
- It's fully usable **offline** (recomended).
- Initally created for my own needs - but I want to share this. 
# CEncryptor - Why I created this?
 I think everyone who has a blockchain wallet has some concerns about seed phrase security. Now, when I go deeper and deeper into different blockchains - I have >10 seed phase papers... I was worrying about different risks, that might happen... You never know...
 - How to store it safely? 
 - Is it safe from fire, water, thieves, police, ...etc. 
 
 I "googled" around and most of the suggestions "how to" where ridiculous! Thats why I thougt - "How to create secure digital format?"
 I want to store it multiple cloud services (+ local copy) without worrying that someone can read/decode it.
 I believe digital format (with encryption) is the most secure...

# I will give $100 if someone can decode this

# Is this app valuable for you? 
It's free to use for everyone - and always will be.
If you want to thank me - you can do it in this "[Thank you](https://github.com/CryptoToolCommunity/CEncryptor/wiki/Thank-you "Thank you")" page

# Future plans
I have plans to create multiple **on-chain metric agregator apps** ("wallet investigator", "Contract flow", "Top Holder behaviour metrics")  in the future. If this project will give me some financial support - it could make it happen faster...
